Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the manner that both concepts tackle the idea of continued website/application functionality even when facing failures or disruptions. Graceful degradation ensures that a system doesn't completely crash when faced with problems. The system will keep running with basic functionality even if at lower levels of maximum functionality expectancy. Service workers relate to this idea because SW allow websites to remain functional even if a problem like losing access to the network happens. Service workers can access data saved in the cache to allow the user to interact with the website.
